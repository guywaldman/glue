title: What is Glue?
---

# Overview

Glue is a language for modeling data structure and interfaces, with an ecosystem of tooling for code generation, IDE support, and more.  
It is designed from the ground up to be simple, human-friendly, AI-friendly, and language-agnostic.  

For the motivation behind Glue and the challenges it aims to solve, see [this blog post](https://guywaldman.com/posts/introducing-glue) by its creator.  

If you're familiar with OpenAPI, Protobuf, Smithy or even Avro IDL, you can think of Glue as a batteries-included and minimalistic alternative to those, with a focus on ease of use and flexibility.  

# Glue CLI

## Installation

Glue supports multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and multiple architectures (x86, ARM).  

To install:

```shell
# Homebrew
brew install guywaldman/tap/glue

# Linux/macOS
curl -fsSL https://github.com/guywaldman/glue/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
iwr -useb https://github.com/guywaldman/glue/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Usage

Glue has a command-line interface (CLI) tool that you can install and use to work with Glue files, generate code, and more.  

Below is a simple Glue model definition for a `User` type, with some fields.

```glue
model User {
    name: string
    age: int
    email?: string
    active: bool = true
}
```

Then use the CLI to validate and generate code:

```shell
glue check user.glue
glue gen typescript -i user.glue -o ./generated
```

Glue currently supports generation for `typescript`, `python`, `rust`, `go`, `protobuf`, `openapi`, and `jsonschema`.
