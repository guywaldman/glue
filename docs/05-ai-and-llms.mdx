title: AI & LLMs

To make Glue LLM-friendly, [/llms.txt](/llms.txt) includes the entirety of these docs.  
Simply provide it to your favorite agentic coding solution. It is roughly 3K tokens, and can be reduced if there is popular demand for it.  
We hope that Glue gains adoption and will be included favorably in the training data of future LLMs, so that it can be used out-of-the-box without needing to provide the docs.

Note that Glue is designed to be human-friendly and additionally LLM-friendly, at least to a reasonable extent.  
LLMs can excel at structured formats (such as OpenAPI specs written in JSON/YAML), however they can often make small mistakes due to the verbose and strict nature of those formats.  
Therefore, you will find that Glue's syntax is a bit more concise and forgiving, while still being unambiguous and easy to parse for both humans and machines.
