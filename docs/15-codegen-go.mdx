Glue supports `go` as a code generation target, allowing you to generate Go structs and enums from Glue models.

Simply run:

```shell
glue gen go -i models.glue -o ./models.go
```

## Configuration

You can configure the emitted package name:

```yaml
global:
	config:
		go:
			package_name: myapi
```

## Example

For this Glue spec:

```glue
model User {
	id: string
	@field(alias="first_name")
	firstName: string
	tags?: string[]
}

enum Status: "active" | "inactive"
```

...generating Go...

```shell
glue gen go -i models.glue -o ./models.go
```

...will produce code similar to:

```go
package glue

type User struct {
		Id        string   `json:"id"`
		FirstName string   `json:"first_name"`
		Tags      *[]string `json:"tags,omitempty"`
}

type Status string

const (
		StatusActive   Status = "active"
		StatusInactive Status = "inactive"
)
```

## Notes

- Optional fields are emitted as pointers and include `,omitempty` in JSON tags.
- Unions are emitted as `interface{}`.
- `Record<K, V>` is emitted as `map[K]V`.
- Anonymous model type atoms are currently not supported in Go code generation.
