# Glue

Glue is an IDL (Interface Definition Language) and toolchain for modeling data and interfaces, and a unified toolchain for code generation, IDE support, and more.  
Designed to be simple, fast, human-friendly, AI-friendly, and language-agnostic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The Glue toolchain is in **beta**, use for production with caution and at your own risk. Expect breaking changes and bugs, though we will try to minimize these.
> Feedback and contributions are very welcome!
